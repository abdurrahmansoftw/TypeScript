# Welcome to TypeScript!

### TypeScript (Basic)

Typescript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript. It is a pure object-oriented programming language and it works well for large scale Javascript applications.

This competency area includes data types, Variables Declaration, Variables Scoping, Hoisting and Destructuring, Array and Tuples, Type annotations, Interface and assertions, Functions, classes, and inheritance.

Key Competencies:

1. Data Types - Use multiple data types for variables. One can ask the compiler to ignore the type to take advantage of dynamic types. TS has support for ‘any’ type, primitive data types like number, boolean, string, void, null, undefined, enum.
2. Variables Declaration - Use static type checking and TS has the same syntax as Javascript for defining variables.
3. Variables Scoping, Hoisting, and Destructuring - Define rules for scopes of defined variables and how they can be used.
4. Array and Tuples - Use arrays of either specific or generic types. Use tuples which are arrays in which we can define the data type of each element in the array.
5. Type annotations, Interface, and assertions - Use specific types for each variable defined.
6. Functions - Use functions for performing a set of actions. Create functions with typed parameters, return type annotations, function overloads, default parameter values, rest parameters. Create named functions and anonymous functions.
7. Class - Use of object-oriented class-based approach to creating objects.
8. Inheritance - Use of Inheritance to receive the features, interactions, and behaviors of a class by another class.

### TypeScript (Intermediate)

Typescript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript. It is a pure object-oriented programming language and it works well for large scale Javascript applications.

This competency area includes Access Modifiers, Readonly Modifiers, Accessors, Decorators, Constructors, Instances, and static members.

Key Competencies:

1. Access Modifiers - Understanding of access modifiers (public, private, protected), commonly used to allow access to members in a class.
2. Read-only Modifiers - Use of read-only modifiers to disallow changing of members in an object.
3. Accessors - Use of get/set accessors to access and control and to set the value to a member of an object.
4. Decorators - Use of decorators to communicate information about the functions, class, property, or parameters.
5. Constructors, Instance, and static members - Use of default constructors and parameterized constructors in a class. Use of static members to share a variable across all instances of a class.

### TypeScript (Advanced)

Typescript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript. It is a pure object-oriented programming language and it works well for large scale Javascript applications.

This competency area includes Generics, Interfaces, Interface inheritance, Modules, and Namespaces.

Key Competencies:

1. Generics - Use of generics to create strongly typed collections, be it functions, classes, or interfaces.
2. Interfaces - Use of interfaces to create contracts between itself and any class which implements it.
3. Interface inheritance - Use of interface inheritance to reuse existing interfaces and to inherit the members of the existing interface but not their implementation.
4. Modules and Namespaces - Use of modules and namespaces to restrict access of members outside it, unless exported and imported.
